In the used car business, one of the most popular methods of building inventory is buying used cars from auctions.
The majority of auctions sell the car "as-is," which means that it is the buyer's responsibility to examine the vehicle, check its codes, and take it for a test drive (if allowed).
It can be difficult to judge whether a car is good or bad, occasionally leading to an expensive mistake.
The objective of this project is to use machine learning to discover patterns in the data that will assist buyers in making wiser choices.
We will explore this objective using data provided by Carvana (an online used car retailer), and maintained by Kaggle.
To build a solution, we will consider 73,000 records with 34 dimensions of various data types, and test using a dataset with 48,000 records.
Our project is based on the existing "Don't get kicked!" Kaggle challenge.
